# Why Learning Analytics?
Global trends in education are turning towards "evidence-based" approaches in teaching, institutional management, and educational policy. However, although the concrete provable aspects become prominent, the question of how to get such "evidence" to the people remains. As the use of digital platforms for learning is widespread, especially in higher education and semi-formal courses (e.g. MOOCs), it brings together big data, machine learning, etc.  to process data from digital platforms (Google, Amazon, Facebook) at scale.
