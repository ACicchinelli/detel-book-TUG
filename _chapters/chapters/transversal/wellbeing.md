title: Completing a Happy TEL PhD&#58; Wellbeing in TEL Doctorates
hide: false
permalink: /chapter/transversal/wellbeing/
---

**Abstract**: This chapter lays out one of the key transversal challenges that doctoral students in TEL face, according to a recent survey: experiencing low wellbeing in the form of anxiety, stress or depression (sometimes leading to dropping out of the doctoral studies). From the myriad of factors that research has found relate to these closely intertwined problems, we focus on those you have *some degree of control* about. Three key motivational factors distinguish doctoral students that finish their theses from those that do not: a sustained sense of *progress*, manageable levels of *mental distress*, and being able to *appropriate*  your thesis project. The chapter proposes "deep dives" into each of these motivational factors, and proposes different tips and exercises to foster them. Finally, we close the chapter with a guide to strategize your progress towards your next dissertation milestone, which you can use again and again until you complete finalize your PhD.

## The Problem(s)

NEW *personal, narrative vignette?*


A doctoral degree is one of the most challenging (and long!) educational experiences that a human can undergo. It involves working on a single research question, for which human knowledge has no answer yet, during three or more years. In recent years, there has been an increasing awareness that such protracted and complex learning experience can lead, for many doctoral candidates, to *mental health* challenges and/or the *abandoning* of the doctorate.

### Mental health in the doctorate

> **Reading** (8 min): To get familiar with key research studies on the prevalence of mental health problems (like anxiety, stress or depression), please read the blog post [Is doing a Ph.D. bad... for your mental wellbeing?](https://ahappyphd.org/posts/is-phd-bad-mental-wellbeing/)

### Dropout in the doctorate

>  **Reading** (12 min): To understand how bad is the problem of high dropout rates in doctoral education, and some factors known to be related to doctoral dropouts, read the blog post ["Who drops out of the Ph.D.?"](https://ahappyphd.org/posts/drop-out-phd/).


### What about a *TEL* doctorate specifically?

So far, we have established that mental health and the risk of dropout are widespread in doctoral studies generally. But... does that apply to a doctorate in TEL? Maybe such an exciting field is free from these problems.

As it turns out, a recent (still unpublished) survey study of more than 200 doctoral students and researchers in TEL found out that psychological challenges (e.g., anxiety, depression) and work-life balance are the most difficult ones that they face during the PhD. The figure below illustrates the point:

![How easy are different kinds of challenges in a TEL doctorate, from a survey of 200+ dooctoral students and researchers in TEL. The Likert scale goes from 1 (very difficult to face) to 5 (very easy).](C:\Users\Usuario\workspace\detel-book\_chapters\chapters\transversal\detel-survey.png)



This TEL-specific data, along with the wealth of research cited in the readings above, suggest that mental health and (research) productivity are closely intertwined in a TEL doctorate, and are often hard to manage for many doctoral students. If you feel like you suffer from these problems *now*, or you would like to be prepared for the moment when these challenges come (spoiler alert: they *will* probably come at some point the doctorate), read on!



## Motivational Factors to Complete a (TEL) PhD

NEW *another personal vignette?*

### "Progressing serenely in a project that makes sense"

> **Reading** (8 min): To understand how the sentence above summarizes the three key motivational factors distinguishing doctoral students that finish their PhD from those that do not, read the first half of the blog post ["Cultivating the progress loop in your PhD"](https://ahappyphd.org/posts/progress-loop/) (until the section "A small bit of evidence from the field", included).

#### Exercise: Self-assess your key motivational areas

> **Exercise** (5 min): Take some minutes to reflect individually about how much you feel the different parts of the sentence "Progressing serenely in a project that makes sense" apply to your particular doctoral process right now. Score each of the factors:
>
> * **Progress**: On a 0-10 scale, how well do you think you are PROGRESSING right now in your doctoral studies? (with 0 being no progress at all, and 10 meaning the best progress you can conceive).
> * **Serenity**: On a 0-10 scale, how SERENE (i.e., free from too much emotional distress) your PhD journey is right now? (with 0 being hugely distressing, and 10 meaning no emotional/mental discomfort whatsoever).
> * **Appropriation**: On a 0-10 scale, how much does your doctoral PROJECT MAKE SENSE to you? (with 0 being complete lack of meaning, or not having a PhD project at all, and 10 meaning that your PhD project is crystal clear and makes total sense to you).

We know doctoral students are a busy bunch, so we will use the scores from the exercise above to prioritize which of the "deep dives" below you want to focus on first: **pick the deep dive about the factor with the lowest score**. You can do the others later, or leave them undone if you think you are doing very well on those.

### Deep Dive: Progress and Productivity

We’ve seen progress is crucial for completing long, difficult tasks


The PhD thesis implies many tasks of different kinds
i.e. reading, writing, gathering data, analysis, … having “multiple fronts open”.
Not to mention other obligations you may have outside it!

## Putting it all together: towards your next dissertation milestone

If you have read through this chapter and done the suggested exercises, you probably have a wealth of tips, techniques and advice about how to progress and not abandon the doctorate:

* Important (but infrequent) **milestones** (see the "Map of the PhD" exercise in the deep dive about *Appropriation*)
* More frequent **progress indicators and metrics** (see the fuel in the "Map of the PhD" exercise in the deep dive about Appropriation)
* **Obstacles** to our advancement in the PhD journey (see the "Map of the PhD" exercise in the deep dive about *Appropriation*)
* Practices to better **perceive progress** (see the deep dive on *Progress & Productivity*)
* **Productivity tips and practices** specific for facing the challenges of a TEL PhD (see the deep dive on *Progress & Productivity*)
* **Self-sabotage** tricks that our minds often play, which can derive in mental health problems (see the deep dive on *Mental Health*)
* **Mental health practices and techniques** we can use in our everyday lives when we face such self-sabotage or other emotional challenges of the PhD (see the deep dive on *Mental Health*)

Indeed, now you may have *too many* tips and advice in your repertoire! It can be difficult not to be overwhelmed, or deciding which ones to apply. How do we translate that wealth of ideas into actual progress in our dissertation?

What we need to do now is to **“connect the dots”**: Define a single, important longer-term objective (the next “milestone” in your thesis) and set day-to-day practices aligned with achieving it. Then, we **just start working** on it, with regular (e.g., weekly) **revisions** in which come back to this strategic plan, check our progress, adjust the plan if needed, and define how to continue advancing during next week.

As a capstone of this wellbeing and productivity mini-course, we would like you to take something tangible and personalized away, that enables you to continue progressing in your dissertation. Please do the exercise below to obtain a **Strategic plan towards the next dissertation milestone**.

#### Exercise: Write down a strategy towards your next dissertation milestone

> **Exercise** (30-60min): Please follow these steps.
>
> 1. Go to a quiet place and turn off all distractions, we'll need all our focus and concentration to build this strategic plan. If you have done the exercises proposed above, please have the outputs (diagrams, sheets of paper, etc.) on hand, as we will need them.
> 2. Make a **copy** of [this editable template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bsHbJYGi5woLVC3nkC4oJNQWNNB--yi-ATnn9Vo8StQ/copy) (will require a Google login), and in your copy put there as the **title** what is your **next important dissertation milestone** (something that is a few months away from where you are, see the "Map of the PhD" exercise). In case it is not clear enough, give it a set of very concrete **completion criteria** (i.e., how do we know we achieved the goal or not?) and a (reasonable but challenging) **deadline** to achieve it.
> 3. In the following section of the template, decompose the milestone into more manageable stages or **intermediate milestones** (e.g., different phases of the study you are running, according to your methodology; different sections if it's a document, or [writing phases](https://ahappyphd.org/posts/how-i-write-papers/), if the milestone is about writing a paper), each with a concrete deadline. Then, select **weekly and daily indicators** that will help you achieve the intermediate and large milestone (e.g., if the milestone is about writing, indicators can be a number of words written, or focused time spent writing). You can also take these indicators from the fuel elements in your "Map of the thesis" exercise.
> 4. In the next section of the template, you can detail the most probable **obstacles** you will face to achieve the milestone. These can be **internal obstacles** (those that depend mostly on you, including self-sabotage and other mental health issues we may face) or **external ones** (those that depend on other people or factors outside your control: lack of feedback or resources, collaboration partners, etc.). 
>    1. For the internal obstacles, you can detail what are: a) the main **symptoms** you typically face when trying to achieve this kind of milestone (e.g., recurrent thoughts, emotions, physical sensations); b) things you do controlled by those symptoms, which **take you away** from what is important (e.g., distractions, addictions, destructive behavior); and c) things you could do instead, which would **take you closer** to what is important to you (e.g., milestone-related activities, or self-care). You can take these elements from the exercise "What takes us away from what is important", in the deep dive about *Mental health* above.
>    2. For the external obstacles, make a note of the **obstacle** itself (e.g., supervisor will not provide feedback because he's so busy), what concrete **actions you can take to preemptively avoid** the obstacle from happening (e.g., agree in advance a feedback slot with supervisor, and stick to that deadline), and additional **actions you could take to minimize the damage** that the obstacle inflicts, should it actually happen (e.g., ask other senior lab colleagues for feedback).
> 5. With those overall actions and metrics in place, it is time to plan how exactly we are going to progress towards the milestone **in the coming week**. To do that, first select **this week's 1-3 Most Important Tasks (MITs)**. These are concrete and realistic tasks that we can do in the week, which will for sure mean we have made progress towards the milestone. The "intermediate milestones" you defined above are good candidates for this part. You may also include a MIT not related to the milestone (e.g., if you have an important, obligatory deadline this week that you cannot forego), but make sure that one or more of the MITs are related to critical parts of the dissertation milestone. The point of MITs is to really focus our efforts into achieving these, prioritizing them above distractions and even useful but not critical tasks.
> 6. Then, we define what **tactics would help us this week** in achieving the weekly MITs (and, eventually, the overall milestone). These can be techniques (e.g., the Pomodoro technique), self-imposed rules (always do the thesis stuff before reading email), etc., and can be taken from points #2-4 above, or other advice you found in this book chapter.
> 7. To close the weekly plan, we can also make a table to track **daily and weekly metrics** that will help us stay on track and achieve the milestone: these can be related to long-term self-care (e.g., hours slept) or directly related to the milestone (e.g., hours spent focused writing, if the milestone is about writing a paper).
> 8. Now we come to the final page of the template, in which we plan how we will set out to a great start towards the milestone, **tomorrow**. We first define **tomorrow's MITs**: again, 1-3 tasks that are achievable tomorrow, and which will noticeably "move the needle" towards achieving the weekly MITs. You can also define one non-milestone MIT (again, for critical but unrelated tasks, appointments or deadlines). The idea again is that we will focus our efforts into achieving these tasks, prioritizing them above distractions and even useful but not critical tasks.
> 9. Finally, we add after the day's MITs **other tasks and appointments** that we need to take care of the next day. Again, try to stay realistic when doing this task list: after doing the MITs and unavoidable appointments, how much time do you really have tomorrow? Don't set yourself up for overwhelm by adding 20-something tasks here that there's no way you will accomplish tomorrow!
> 10. A critical and often overlooked step in making this strategic plan work is to **periodically review** it: **Every day**, at the end of the workday, go over the day's plan (steps #8-9), mark your progress (and celebrate it!) and note undone tasks, note down your metrics (step #7) and make a similar plan (MITs, tasks and appointments) for the next day. Similarly, at the end of **each week**, go over the weekly plan (steps #5-7), notice your progress (yay!) and make the plan for the following week. In each of these reviews, see if you need to adjust the overall strategy, deadlines or milestones: it is seldom the case that our original plan (done with incomplete information) will work until completion! Rather, we often need to adjust dates, or modify the scope or number of tasks, eliminating "nice-to-haves", etc.
> 11. Once you hit the dissertation milestone, *really* celebrate: take the afternoon off, do something you really like, go out with some friends. Later, do the strategic plan for the next milestone (go again to step #1). Rinse and repeat. The dissertation will be done in no time! :)
