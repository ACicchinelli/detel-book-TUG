title: Completing a Happy TEL PhD&#58; Wellbeing in TEL Doctorates
hide: false
permalink: /chapter/transversal/wellbeing/
---

**Abstract**: This chapter lays out one of the key transversal challenges that doctoral students in TEL face, according to a recent survey: experiencing low wellbeing in the form of anxiety, stress or depression (sometimes leading to dropping out of the doctoral studies). From the myriad of factors that research has found relate to these closely intertwined problems, we focus on those you have *some degree of control* about. Three key motivational factors distinguish doctoral students that finish their theses from those that do not: a sustained sense of *progress*, manageable levels of *mental distress*, and being able to *appropriate*  your thesis project. The chapter proposes "deep dives" into each of these motivational factors, and proposes different tips and exercises to foster them. Finally, we close the chapter with a guide to strategize your progress towards your next dissertation milestone, which you can use again and again until you complete finalize your PhD.

## The Problem(s)

NEW *personal, narrative vignette?*



A doctoral degree is one of the most challenging (and long!) educational experiences that a human can undergo. It involves working on a single research question, for which human knowledge has no answer yet, during three or more years. In recent years, there has been an increasing awareness that such protracted and complex learning experience can lead, for many doctoral candidates, to *mental health* challenges and/or the *abandoning* of the doctorate.

### Mental health in the doctorate

> **Reading** (8 min): To get familiar with key research studies on the prevalence of mental health problems (like anxiety, stress or depression), please read the blog post [Is doing a Ph.D. bad... for your mental wellbeing?](https://ahappyphd.org/posts/is-phd-bad-mental-wellbeing/)

### Dropout in the doctorate

>  **Reading** (12 min): To understand how bad is the problem of high dropout rates in doctoral education, and some factors known to be related to doctoral dropouts, read the blog post ["Who drops out of the Ph.D.?"](https://ahappyphd.org/posts/drop-out-phd/).

### What about a *TEL* doctorate specifically?

So far, we have established that mental health and the risk of dropout are widespread in doctoral studies generally. But... does that apply to a doctorate in TEL? Maybe such an exciting field is free from these problems.

As it turns out, a recent (still unpublished) survey study of more than 200 doctoral students and researchers in TEL found out that psychological challenges (e.g., anxiety, depression) and work-life balance are the most difficult ones that they face during the PhD. The figure below illustrates the point:

![How easy are different kinds of challenges in a TEL doctorate, from a survey of 200+ dooctoral students and researchers in TEL. The Likert scale goes from 1 (very difficult to face) to 5 (very easy).](C:\Users\Usuario\workspace\detel-book\_chapters\chapters\transversal\detel-survey.png)



This TEL-specific data, along with the wealth of research cited in the readings above, suggest that mental health and (research) productivity are closely intertwined in a TEL doctorate, and are often hard to manage for many doctoral students. If you feel like you suffer from these problems *now*, or you would like to be prepared for the moment when these challenges come (spoiler alert: they *will* probably come at some point the doctorate), read on!



## Motivational Factors to Complete a (TEL) PhD

NEW *another personal vignette?*

### "Progressing serenely in a project that makes sense"

> **Reading** (8 min): To understand how the sentence above summarizes the three key motivational factors distinguishing doctoral students that finish their PhD from those that do not, read the first half of the blog post ["Cultivating the progress loop in your PhD"](https://ahappyphd.org/posts/progress-loop/) (until the section "A small bit of evidence from the field", included).

#### Exercise: Self-assess your key motivational areas

> **Exercise** (5 min): Take some minutes to reflect individually about how much you feel the different parts of the sentence "Progressing serenely in a project that makes sense" apply to your particular doctoral process right now. Score each of the factors:
>
> * **Progress**: On a 0-10 scale, how well do you think you are PROGRESSING right now in your doctoral studies? (with 0 being no progress at all, and 10 meaning the best progress you can conceive).
> * **Serenity**: On a 0-10 scale, how SERENE (i.e., free from too much emotional distress) your PhD journey is right now? (with 0 being hugely distressing, and 10 meaning no emotional/mental discomfort whatsoever).
> * **Appropriation**: On a 0-10 scale, how much does your doctoral PROJECT MAKE SENSE to you? (with 0 being complete lack of meaning, or not having a PhD project at all, and 10 meaning that your PhD project is crystal clear and makes total sense to you).

We know doctoral students are a busy bunch, so we will use the scores from the exercise above to prioritize which of the "deep dives" below you want to focus on first: **pick the deep dive about the factor with the lowest score**. You can do the others later, or leave them undone if you think you are doing very well on those.

### Deep Dive: Progress and Productivity

We’ve seen progress is crucial for completing long, difficult tasks


The PhD thesis implies many tasks of different kinds
i.e. reading, writing, gathering data, analysis, … having “multiple fronts open”.
Not to mention other obligations you may have outside it!


How to stay sane and finish on time? (and enjoy it!?)
