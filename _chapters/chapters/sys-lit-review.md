# Systematic Literature Review
## Introduction

## Literature review
A literature review is a common practice and a central part of academic research. It provides an overview of what is known about a particular topic and a critical evaluation of the existing published work in a selected research area.
A good literature review is a critical discussion, displaying the writer’s knowledge on relevant theories and approaches and awareness of contrasting arguments. Through the literature review the researcher is able to identify gaps in the literature, the need to fill them with new research and to locate their original work whiting the existing literature. 

## Literature review vs Systematic Literature Review
Before focusing on the systematic review of the literature, it is considered relevant to present the differences between a literature review and a systematic literature review

  |                       | Literature review	|Systematic literature review
  |:----------------------|:------------------|:---------------------------|
  | Definition | Critical evaluation of the existing published work in a selected research area.|Type of literature review that is focused on a particular research question.|
  | Goal       | To review the existing literature, identify the research gap, place the research study in relation to other studies, to evaluate promising research methods, and to suggest further research.	| To identify, review, and summarize the best available research on a specific research question.
  | Research Questions | Formed after writing the literature review and identifying the research gap.	|Formed at the beginning of the systematic review.
  | Research Studies   |Essential component of a research study and is done at the beginning of the study.	| Not followed by a separate research study.



## Systematic Literature Review-Definition

Systematic literature review (also referred to as a systematic review) is a form of secondary study that uses a well-defined methodology to identify, analyse and interpret all available evidence related to a specific research question (Kitchenham, B. & Charters, S. 2007)

Systematic reviews can be defined as “a review of existing research using explicit, accountable  rigorous research methods” (Mark Newman and David Gough, 2020)

### Glossary

* **Primary study:** an empirical study investigating a specific research question.
* **Secondary study:** a study that reviews all the primary studies relating with the aim of integrating/synthezising evidence related to a specific research question.
* **Systematic review protocol:** a plan that describes the conduct of a proposed systematic literature review.

## Systematic Literature Review-Process
This section first provides an overview of the phases (see also Fig 1: Xiao & Watson, 2019 diagram) involved in conducting a systematic literature review and then focuses on each phase with a brief explanation and examples.

  * Planning the SLR: 
    * Identify the need for a systematic review
    * Formulate of a focused review question
    * Consider scope and inclusion and exclusion criteria

  * Conducting the SLR:
    * Conduct a comprehensive, exhaustive search for primary studies
    * Assess and screen the studies
    * Extract data from the studies

  * Reporting the SLR:
    * Summarize and synthetize the study results 
    * Interpret the results to determine their applicability
    * Report-writing

### Planning the Systematic Literaure Review

#### The role of the research questions:
Specifying the research questions is the most important part of any systematic review.
A clear, specific and answerable question is essential to a successful systematic review. A well formulated question will help to determine the protocol and search strategy and help to find relevant and valid information. In this way the research question guide the whole process:

o	The search process must identify primary studies that address the research questions.
o	The data extraction process must extract the data items needed to answer the questions.
o	The data analysis process must synthesise the data in such a way that the questions can be answered.
