The DETEL Book is an open educational resource developed by an open community of contributors. It is constantly evolving and updated in contrast to the traditional books that are published once (or in editions).

The development of the DETEL book is initiated by the [DETEL project](https://ea-tel.eu/de-tel) that works to establish and deepen a strategic partnership for doctoral education in Technology-Enhanced Learning. DETEL brings together 9 internationally renowned universities and the European Association of Technology-Enhanced Learning to reflect their expertise in doctoral education into a new internationally validated program in TEL, extended with rich and professionally produced Open Educational Resources. The project grounds the design of the new program in the best practices in TEL doctoral education across Europe as well as institutional and national requirements. This project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Erasmus Plus programme, grant agreement [2019-1-NO01-KA203-060280](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/projects/eplus-project-details/#project/2019-1-NO01-KA203-060280).

It is an open educational resource with a CC-BY-SA-4.0 license. Contributions are welcome!
